This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app.

Database Schema
This project uses Drizzle ORM for database management. The schema is defined in src/db/schema.ts.

⚠️ CRITICAL: Do Not Delete or Edit the kv Table
The kv table in src/db/schema.ts is a required built-in table that must never be removed or modified. Deleting or editing this table definition will cause:

Database schema conflicts during deployment
Interactive prompts during drizzle-kit push that block app startup
Deployment failures and health check timeouts
Rules for the kv table:

❌ Never delete the table definition
❌ Never modify the table name, fields, or types
❌ Never rename or comment out the table
✅ Always keep it exactly as defined in the template
Always keep the kv table definition unchanged in your schema file, even if you don't use it.

Adding Custom Tables
Add your custom table definitions below the kv table in src/db/schema.ts. See the examples in that file for reference.

Database Schema Push Behavior
The db:push command uses drizzle-kit push to synchronize your schema with the database. This command is configured to fail fast rather than prompt for user input.

Important behavior:

The push command will fail immediately if there are ambiguous or destructive schema changes
This is intentional to prevent blocking deployments
Common failure scenarios:
Renaming columns (Drizzle can't distinguish rename from delete+add)
Renaming tables
Adding constraints to tables with existing data
Ambiguous schema changes
When the push fails, you should:

Make non-destructive changes instead:
Instead of renaming columns: Add a new column, migrate data, then remove the old column in a separate change
Instead of renaming tables: Create a new table with the desired name
Instead of adding unique constraints to populated tables: Clear data first or use nullable fields
Review the error message from drizzle-kit push to understand what change is ambiguous
Adjust your schema to be more explicit and non-destructive
Getting Started
First, run the development server:

bash


pnpm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Geist, a new font family for Vercel.
